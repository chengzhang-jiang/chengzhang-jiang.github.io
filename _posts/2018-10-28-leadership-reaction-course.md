title: "Eight Takeaways from Leadership Reaction Course"
---

I would like to write a post but there are just so many contents here.

What an enjoyable day! It is so worthwhile to get up at 5 am heading to Fort Benning to receive the leadership training, which provides teams with the opportunity to solve obstacles like building bridges with boards and ropes over water and get to the other side. Big thanks to my fantastic AWESOME teammates, we completed 5 tasks out of 6 today!

You are so smart, brave and cooperative!

Lessons here:

1. Have at least a draft plan at first before starting to work. Because that will help reduce frictions in the process. For example, it can happen that someone without plans gets stuck in the middle and cannot move anywhere. Will was pretty good at planning. In Lane 1, he first had a vision of the steps and broke down the problems into two parts and said what if you guys worked on that part while we tried to solve this part. However, there is a trade-off there. We cannot spend too much time planning or we will have no time left for execution. It is always not feasible to come up with a perfect plan at first. What is recommended is to make a 80% plan before doing anything and then improve it little by little as we make progress. Meanwhile, confidence is gained to help us get even further.

2. Planning is also about recognizing the strengths of different members. From the leaders’ standpoint, he or she may need to assign different sub-tasks to different members accordingly.

3. Listen to your teammates. Amy and Ranan really contributed good ideas but we focused on other stuff at that time and did not hear clearly. Then we were reminded by our coach that their ideas were valuable.

4. Have assumptions and test it quickly. Sometimes we have assumptions in mind which may be correct but we are not sure. The next step is just to test it. After Ranan raised the question, "do the two pipes fit?". Jacky was brave to step on the ladder which extended to the water area and lifted the pipe to match. It worked and turned out to be a critical step to solve this problem.

5. Succession plan. What if team leader gets into water (trouble) and not able to help. Will someone else predetermined take charge?

6. Communication matters. Sometimes team members can have the illusion that they fully understand what the task and plan is. Leaders need to confirm from time to time that there is real consensus to avoid something like anyone acting against the plan unintentionally. Whenever I feel like I miss something important, I need to ask and catch up.

7. Believe in yourself; trust and take care of teammates. We tend to get terrified in face of something not familiar to us. We doubt whether we can stand firmly and balance well on boards. But after doing that, we realized we could do it! Success of other teammates could also boost confidence. On the other hand, when I got down from a high pipe in the air, I was not afraid at all because I was 100% sure that my teammates would support me. And it is really lucky to have such a caring team on which everyone not only pursues the success but also frequently asks each other whether they are fine up there.

8. Participation especially when it is hard. It is admirable that everyone tries their best to overcome fear for height for the sake of team. Additionally, brilliant ideas emerge from participation.

I always think that the ultimate goal of teamwork is to make everyone feel pretty good about not only the outcomes but also the work they have done individually and collaboratively in the process. It also makes us feel so good to grow together. I can’t wait to leverage this experience to group projects and career. Again, I feel so fortunate to team up with you guys and best wishes to you all!
